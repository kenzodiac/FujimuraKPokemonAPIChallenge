- "Pokemon API Challenge"
- This assignment was to make a single page web app that called multiple APIs to bring back various types of information about Pokemon. It was also an assignment to introduce us to and practice Tailwind CSS, and be fully responsive. I did not like this assignment.
- Notes: If you click on the picture of the Pokemon that's called, it will switch the image between normal and shiny types. The assignment was also only supposed to be searchable for the first 5 generations of Pokemon, but I made it work with all 9 generations.
